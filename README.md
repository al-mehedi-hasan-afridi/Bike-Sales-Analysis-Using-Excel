- Those who didnâ€™t purchase a bike have a lower income, with **females** earning **$53,440** and **males** earning **$56,208**.
- Higher income correlates with a higher likelihood of purchasing a bike for both genders.

- This suggests that middle-aged customers are more likely to buy bikes, perhaps due to lifestyle or commuting needs.
